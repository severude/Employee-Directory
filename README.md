# Employee-Directory

Many sites — Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Wikipedia to name a few — offer a vast sea of data that you can access and display on your own web pages. Using JavaScript, you’ll create an employee directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).

You did it! Now, you have the tools to create your own AJAX requests to include in your own lovely projects. The JQuery site has all of the options that are available to you in order to configure what you want. Making requests for the client is going to be a huge part of the program from this project on. Have a wonderful day/evening!
